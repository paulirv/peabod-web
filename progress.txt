## Completed Work

### Issue #4: www Redirect

- Expanded middleware matcher to handle all routes (previously only /admin routes)

### Issue #5: Copyright Field Removal
- Removed `copyright_text` from `SiteSettings` interface in `src/app/admin/api/settings/route.ts`
- Removed `copyright_text` from `UpdateSettingsBody` interface
- Removed field from the update fields array
- Removed `copyright_text` from `PublicSettings` interface in `src/lib/settings.ts`
- Removed field from the SQL query
- Removed Copyright Text input from admin settings page `src/app/admin/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
- Updated Footer to accept `siteName` prop and auto-generate copyright as "© [year] [siteName]. All rights reserved."
- Updated public layout to pass `siteName` to Footer

### Issue #6: Theme Picker in Footer
- Moved theme picker from Header hamburger menu to Footer
- Implemented as a right-aligned chip showing current theme name and color preview
