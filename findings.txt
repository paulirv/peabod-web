## Technical Decisions

### Middleware for www Redirect
- Used Next.js middleware for the redirect instead of Cloudflare rules
- This keeps the redirect logic in the codebase rather than infrastructure
- 301 permanent redirect used for SEO benefits
- Expanded matcher pattern to handle all routes, not just /admin

### Footer as Client Component
- Changed Footer from server component to client component
- Required for theme picker state management and click-outside handling
- Uses the same `useTheme` hook pattern as the original Header implementation

### Auto-generated Copyright
- Format: "© [year] [siteName]. All rights reserved."
- Year is dynamically generated using `new Date().getFullYear()`
- Site name falls back to "Site Name" if not set in settings
- Matches the format specified in issue #5

## No Migration Needed
- The `copyright_text` column remains in the database schema but is no longer used
- Decided not to add a migration to remove the column as it causes no harm and could break existing data if someone needs to rollback
